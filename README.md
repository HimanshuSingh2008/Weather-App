<h1 align="center">🌦️ Weather Application</h1>

<p align="center">
  A modern weather application that provides real-time weather information
  based on user location or city search. Built using web technologies to
  demonstrate API integration, data handling, and responsive UI design.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>🎯 Key Focus Areas (Placements & Internships)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>API Integration:</strong>
    Fetches real-time weather data from a public weather API and displays
    accurate, up-to-date information.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Asynchronous JavaScript:</strong>
    Uses asynchronous programming concepts such as promises and async/await
    for efficient data fetching and error handling.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>User-Centric Design:</strong>
    Clean, responsive interface with intuitive input and clear weather visualization.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>✨ Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Real-time weather data by city name</li>
  <li>Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions</li>
  <li>Error handling for invalid city names or network issues</li>
  <li>Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices</li>
  <li>Fast and lightweight performance</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML5</strong> – Structure and layout</li>
  <li><strong>CSS3</strong> – Styling and responsive design</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript (ES6)</strong> – Logic, API handling, and interactivity</li>
  <li><strong>Weather API</strong> – Real-time data source</li>
</ul>

<h2>📌 Objective</h2>
<p>
  This project is developed to strengthen my understanding of API integration,
  asynchronous JavaScript, and front-end application development.
  It serves as a practical project for internship and placement preparation.
